# tic tak toe ai
 a simple Java code that plays the game tic-tak-toe with the user.

how it works: it just analyses each move and gives a status (X wins, Draw, O wins) to each move possible on the board, to do analysing a move, the program should analyse the next moves using the backtracking algorithm. then, after analysis is complete, the AI will choose the best move (firstly tries to play a move leading to win, then tries to play a move leading to draw, then tries to play a move leading to lost)
